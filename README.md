### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [book catalogue link] - a catalogue of all my books built in React/Typescript  
This is a WIP BE/FE project, currently with both parts in one repo: [repo link]

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working on https://code-word.herokuapp.com/ - a recreation of Code Names as an online board game with sockets.  
This was a weekend challenge, so the repo is quite a mess! https://github.com/gargleyark/code-word

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently strengthening my understanding of pipelines & devops

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Javascript or bookbinding
